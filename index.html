    <h1>Hello CodeWorks</h1>

    <p>My name is <strong>Mandi Linville</strong></p>

    <p>I am a life long learner in pursuit of a new career. I was a Special Education teacher for three years 
        before recognizing my interest in development / programming. My interest in development / programming arose out of personal need while searching for 
        someone to develop a website for a veteran's advocacy LLC I co-founded with my husband. I realized that I prefer to develop the website myself
        exactly the way I wanted it to look. Thanks to Mission 43 and my husband's dutiful military service, this opportunity 
        became available to me via Boise Code Works. I intend to become a consciously competent developer, while carrying on my duties
        as the wife and caregiver of my combat wounded warrior, mother of two amazing daughters, and co-founder of Beyond the Limbit.
